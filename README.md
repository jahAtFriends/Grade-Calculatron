## Grade Calculation
Grades are calculated according to the following algorithm:

1. Each rubric category is assigned a letter grade (A+ through F)
2. Letter grades are converted to a 4-point scale
3. A weighted average is taken of the 4-point scores from each category
4. The average is converted back into a letter grade and a percent score

### Conversion between letter grades, 4-point scale, and percentages
Whenever a conversion between letter grades, 4-point scores, and percentages is needed,
the following table serves as a reference. Note that percentage grades are always rounded
to the nearest whole percent.

| Letter Grade | 4-point Score | Percentage Range |
|-------------------------------------------------|
|     A+       | 4.0           | 96% - 97%        |
